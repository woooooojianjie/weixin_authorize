# This file was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause this
# file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# (such as loading up an entire rails app) will add to the boot time of your
# test suite on EVERY test run, even for an individual file that may not need
# all of that loaded.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
